# pymap

A program for describing how different selections of degrees of freedom (mappings) affect the amount of information retained about a full data set composed by discrete degrees of freedom.

Three quantities are calculated for each coarse-grained mappings, namely the mapping entropy:

![equ](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?S_{map}&space;=&space;\sum_{\phi}p(\phi)&space;\ln\left(\frac{p(\phi)}{\overline{p(\phi)}}&space;\right))

the resolution:

![equ](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?H_{s}&space;=&space;-\sum_{\phi}p(\phi)&space;\ln\left(p(\phi)\right))

and the relevance:

![equ](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?H_{k}&space;=&space;-\sum_{K}p(k)\ln\left(p(k)\right).)

where K is the set of unique frequencies observed in the sample.

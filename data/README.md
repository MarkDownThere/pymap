# Data sets

The available data sets are
- *spins.csv*, corresponding to the sample of the system of non-interacting spins in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00100)
- *m1.csv*, corresponding to the *m1* model in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00100)
- *m2.csv*, corresponding to the *m2* model in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00100)

The columns of each data set represent the degrees of freedom of the high-resolution model. Each row is a realisation of the complex system encoded in a set of dicrete values, one for each column.
